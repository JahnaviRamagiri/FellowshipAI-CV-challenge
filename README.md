# Computer Vision Challenge: Flower Classification

This README provides an overview of the solution for the computer vision challenge, which involves training a pre-trained ResNet 50 model on the Flowers dataset for flower classification.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this challenge is to develop a model that accurately classifies different flower species based on input images. I am provided with the Flowers dataset, which contains a collection of images belonging to various flower categories.

## Approach

To tackle the challenge, I employed the following approach:

1. **Data Preparation:** I split the Flowers dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that I have separate datasets for training the model, evaluating its performance during development, and testing the final trained model's accuracy on unseen data.

2. **Pre-trained Model:** I utilized the ResNet 50 architecture as a pre-trained model. The pre-trained model has been trained on large-scale image datasets and can extract meaningful features from images.

3. **Fine-tuning:** I performed fine-tuning by retraining the last few layers of the pre-trained ResNet 50 model on the Flowers dataset. This process allows the model to adapt its learned representations to the specific task of flower classification. Further, a Sequential Model of 2 layers was added at the end of the pre-trained model architecture.

4. **Training and Optimization:** I trained the model using the training set and monitored its performance on the validation set. Techniques such as data augmentation, feature scaling, and regularization are employed to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

5. **Model Evaluation:** After training, the model's performance on the test set is evaluated. GRADCAM outputs show the misclassified predictions and their gradients.

## Data Visualization

To gain insights into the dataset and the model's behavior, I employed various data visualization techniques:

- **Class Distribution:** Plotted the distribution of flower categories in the dataset to identify any class imbalances that might affect the model's performance. 

- **Sample Images:** Displayed a few sample images from each flower category to gain a visual understanding of the dataset and the visual differences between different flowers. This visualization assists in identifying unique characteristics and challenges associated with each class.

- **Feature Maps:** Visualizing the feature maps or activation maps at different layers of the network helps understand what the model is learning and how it represents different features. This visualization aids in interpreting the model's internal representations.

## Augmentation using Albumentations

For data augmentation, I utilized the Albumentations library, which offers a wide range of image augmentation techniques. Albumentations provide efficient and flexible transformations such as random rotations, flips, zooms, and color adjustments. By applying these augmentations, the diversity of the dataset is improved, helping the model generalize better and reducing overfitting.

## Class Imbalance and Overfitting

During the classification task, it is crucial to consider class imbalance and overfitting:

- **Class Imbalance:** Class imbalance refers to a situation where the number of examples in each class is not evenly distributed. It can lead to biased model predictions, with higher accuracy on the majority class and poor performance on minority classes. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights can help address class imbalance.

- **Overfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Signs of overfitting include high accuracy on the training set but poor performance on the validation or test sets. Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, can mitigate overfitting.

## Bugs in the Code

To ensure the absence of bugs and maintain the reliability of the code, the following steps are implemented:

- Implement comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components and functions in the code.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets and monitor the model's performance on the validation set during training to ensure it's not overfitting.
- Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on multiple splits of the data and evaluate its stability.
- Compare the model's performance with existing benchmarks or previous results to ensure it falls within a reasonable range.


## Future Scope

While our model achieved satisfactory results, there are several avenues for future improvement and exploration:

- **Dataset Size:** The Flowers dataset is relatively small, which can limit the model's ability to generalize well. Expanding the dataset with additional images or considering larger-scale datasets may enhance performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further exploration of hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques, could potentially improve the model's accuracy.
- **Architecture Modifications:** Experimenting with different network architectures or variations of the ResNet model, such as ResNet with more layers (e.g., ResNet 101 or ResNet 152), may capture more intricate features and boost performance.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combining predictions from multiple models or using ensemble learning techniques, such as bagging or boosting, could potentially improve the model's robustness and accuracy.
